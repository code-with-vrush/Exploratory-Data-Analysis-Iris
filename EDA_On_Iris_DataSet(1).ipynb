It was invented by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and it aims at being understandable, with a stress on code readability, requiring features, and fewer lines of code to maintain it. Concerning the programming paradigms Python supports, one ought to know that it supports procedural, object oriented, and functional programming. Another important feature of the language is the given real-time availability of dynamic typing where the variable type does not have given type and is defined during the programâ€™s execution. This makes Python quite flexible and also it is easy to write Python programs. It also has a large set of standard libraries that is ready made constructions and procedures needed to accomplish certain tasks like File and system Input/Output, Internet services processing of data etc Python is applied in number systems like web development, numerical computing data analysis artificial intelligence automation etc. For these reasons, efficiency and practicability, it has emerged as one of the most employed frameworks of developers for prototyping as well as subsequent implementation. Also, it has a large number of followers that contribute to improving the language itself, which also actively replenishes the third-party libraries and frameworks to expand its functionality.\n","\n","\n","```\n","#here is example of python code:-\n","        print(\"hello python\")\n","```\n","---\n","#<span style='font-size:80px;'>&#9734;</span><u>what is Pandas in Python</u>?\n","\n","<span style='font-size:50px;'>&#8618;</span><b>Pandas</b> is a data manipulation and analysis library for the programming language of Python that aims to become perfect and quick to handle data tables and similar structures. It provides two primary data structures: DataFrame and Series: both of them are two data containers in the Panda Library that are used to store the dated data. Whereas, a DataFrame is flexible in terms of size and number of columns and rows as well as the type of data being held in it and the data can be accessed using referencing through row and column names while, Series is a one-dimensional single array with varied types of data and the referencing of the data is done through its label.\n","\n","Pandas contains many data manipulation operations including merge/join the given datasets, reshape the data and group by operation for an aggregation. It also contains the sound data preprocessing features including handling of the missing data, filtering and type conversion. As well, the computation with time series is another one of the strong sides of the Pandas, because the library has specific functions that are useful for resampling the data, shift the time, use the rolling windows. They include operations that allow one to conveniently read from and write to various formats such as CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON.\n","\n","Pandas seamlessly integrates well with the packages that exist on Python with regard to data analysis these include; NumPy which is efficient in numerical calculation, Matplotlib which is efficient in data visualization and SciPy which is efficient in general computation in science and engineering.
